### Implementing Custom Message Routing with Priority in Painless Mesh

This guide provides a step-by-step approach for students to implement a custom message routing protocol with priority handling using the Painless Mesh library without modifying the library itself. This is achieved by managing message priorities at the application level.

#### Step 1: Define a Custom Message Structure

- Create a `CustomMessage` struct that includes a `targetId` for the destination, a `payload` for the message content, and a `priority` to indicate the message's importance.

#### Step 2: Serialize and Deserialize Messages

- Use JSON to serialize and deserialize your `CustomMessage` structure. This allows you to send and receive complex data structures over the Painless Mesh network easily.

#### Step 3: Implement a Priority Message Queue

- Develop a message queue within your application that sorts messages based on their priority. This ensures that higher priority messages are processed first.

#### Step 4: Integrate with Painless Mesh

- When sending messages, serialize your `CustomMessage` and send the resulting string via Painless Mesh. Upon receiving a message, deserialize it back into a `CustomMessage` and process it according to its priority.

#### Key Concepts to Understand:

- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Converting a custom data structure into a format that can be easily sent over the network and then converting it back.
- **Priority Queue**: A data structure that allows elements to be processed based on their priority rather than just their order in the queue.
- **Message Routing**: The process of determining how messages are transmitted through the network from the sender to the recipient.

#### Practical Tips:

- Experiment with different priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to see how they affect message processing.
- Ensure your priority queue correctly sorts messages so that higher priority messages are always processed first.
- Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected in various scenarios, including high network traffic and with nodes joining or leaving the mesh network.

This exercise will help you understand how to manage complex data flows in mesh networks and how to implement custom logic on top of existing communication protocols.
